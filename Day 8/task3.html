    <h3>Grouping Selectors</h3>
    <h1>Selectors are much needed for CSS</h1>
<h4> It improves readability and consistency across the webpage</h4>

     <p>
        <h3>CSS Grouped Selectors</h3>
    CSS grouped selectors allow you to apply the same style to multiple HTML elements at once. 
    For example, you can style all headings like <b>h1, h2, and h3</b> together without repeating the same code multiple times.
    This makes your stylesheet shorter and easier to maintain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Grouped selectors are written by separating element names with a comma. 
    For instance, h1, h2, h3 green applies the same color to all these heading levels.
    This technique improves readability and consistency across your webpage.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    Using grouped selectors is especially useful in large projects where many similar elements share common styles. 
    It ensures design uniformity and saves a lot of time during development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember that each element inside the group will receive exactly the same styling rules. 
    If you want to customize one of them later, you can still use an ID or class selector for that specific element.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, grouping selectors is one of the simplest yet most powerful ways to keep your CSS clean, organized, and efficient.
    Itâ€™s a great habit to develop as you continue learning web design.
