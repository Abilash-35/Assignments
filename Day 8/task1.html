<!-- Inline CSS -->
    <p style="background-color: yellow;">
           The world of web development is constantly evolving, and learning HTML and CSS forms the foundation of it all. 
        With inline CSS, you can quickly style individual elements directly in the HTML tag using the <code>style</code> attribute. 
        Although it's not the most efficient method for large projects, its perfect for testing or small design tweaks. 
        Inline CSS allows developers to see instant results without switching files, 
        making it ideal for beginners learning how styling works.

    <p class="para" style="background-color: pink;">
        Internal CSS is placed inside the style tag within the HTML document's head section. 
        This method allows you to apply styles to multiple elements on the same page without using an external file. 
        It's great for projects with a single page or when you want to test multiple styles together. 
        For instance, you can define a class once and apply it to any element throughout the document. 
        It keeps your HTML clean while still giving you centralized control over the styles.

    </p>
    <p>
         External CSS is considered the most powerful and organized method for styling web pages. 
        By linking a separate CSS file using the link tag, you can control the design of multiple web pages from one place. 
        This approach promotes reusability, faster maintenance, and consistent design across large websites. 
        External stylesheets are used in nearly all professional websites, as they keep content 
        (HTML) and design (CSS) clearly separated, following the best practices of web development.
    </p>
    <p>
            Combining inline and internal CSS can be helpful in cases
             where you want most of your design controlled by internal styles, 
        but need to make one or two quick overrides. For example, 
        if a particular paragraph needs a slightly different background or text color, 
        you can easily apply it inline without creating a new class. However, 
        this method should be used sparingly to avoid confusion in large projects.
    </p>
    <p>
         The most flexible approach is combining inline, internal, and external CSS when necessary. 
        For example, you might use external CSS for your main design, 
        internal CSS for a page-specific layout, and inline CSS for quick adjustments or dynamic styling. 
        In modern development, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or 
        Tailwind often work alongside these traditional methods to create responsive, attractive
        , and consistent designs efficiently.
