      <!-- Type selector  -->
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

  <!-- Type selector  -->
  <p>This is a simple paragraph using the type selector its perfect for testing or small design tweaks. 
        Inline CSS allows developers to see instant results without switching files, 
        making it ideal for beginners learning how styling works. </p>

  <!--Class selector -->
  <p class="highlight">This paragraph uses the <b>.highlight class selector. It's great for projects with a single page or when you want to test multiple styles together. 
        For instance, you can define a class once and apply it to any element throughout the document. </p>

  <!-- ID selector -->
  <div id="about">
    <h2>About Section</h2>
    <p>This section is styled with the <b>#about</b> ID selector.For example, you might use external CSS for your main design, 
        internal CSS for a page-specific layout, and inline CSS for quick adjustments or dynamic styling. /p>
  </div>

  <!--  Another class selector -->
  <p class="note">Note: You can mix and reuse class selectors on multiple elements!
            Combining inline and internal CSS can be helpful in cases
             where you want most of your design controlled by internal styles, 
        but need to make one or two quick overrides. For example, 
        if a particular paragraph needs a slightly different background or text color, 
        you can easily apply it inline without creating a new class.</p>
