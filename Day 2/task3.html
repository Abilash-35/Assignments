    <h2>Difference between &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;</h2>

      <!-- Example of Div Element  -->
    <div>
        This is a <strong>div</strong> element . Here it takes up a full width 
        of the webpage.
    </div>

    <!-- Example of Span Element  -->

    <p> 
        This is a paragraph
        <span style="color:red">
            Unline div, span takes only that part text
             content as width and stays as inline
        </span>
    </p>
</body>

<!-- 
Div Element - It is a block level element, 
it takes full width of Page. It starts on a new line.

Span Element - It is a Inline element, which takes that text part as width 
as Inline . It does not start in a new line. Uses in a flow how the 
text would be.  -->
